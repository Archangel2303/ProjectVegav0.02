Today we:

Implemented the FF7-style battle menu with Slate, including ability list, category coloring, and special glow styling, plus a tighter hover glow for command/ability buttons.
Added targeting UX previews (cursor marker, splash ring, target box/label).
Added floor/encounter scaffolding: floor map nodes, encounter pools, floor definition, and a run-state subsystem to carry loadout and encounter selection.
Added an encounter manager actor to spawn the player/enemies and drive AI turns, plus AI target scoring by role/threat.
Switched encounter spawn points to scene component roots for easier setup.
Added a lightweight floor map widget that lists nodes and calls SelectNode.
Checklist for a playable Floor One

Create and populate Encounter Definition assets (enemy classes + counts).
Create Encounter Pool assets (easy/medium/hard/mini-boss/boss weights).
Create a Floor Definition asset and set EncounterMapName to your encounter level.
Add EncounterManager to the encounter level and confirm spawn points are placed.
Enable the floor map widget (or create a floor map UI that calls GenerateFloorMap, SelectNode, StartSelectedEncounter).
Playtest loop: floor map ? choose node ? encounter loads ? player spawns with loadout ? enemies spawn ? AI acts ? win/lose.
